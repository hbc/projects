This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r 2}
load("~/test.RDATA")
```

```{r gvis, results='asis'}
library(googleVis)
pd <- as.data.frame(apply(pd, 2, as.character))
print(gvisTable(pd), "chart")
```
